I'm an incoming Masters Student at UTD, specializing in Machine Learning. 
I'm the Executive Director of Programs and Branding of [ALM, the first Muslim interest fraternity in America](https://www.alphalambdamu.org/).

This blog is for Public Learning. Generally going to talk about productivity, mindfulness, Islam, honestly anything so I won't put myself in a box.

If you have criticism, comments, really anything to say, hit my line.
